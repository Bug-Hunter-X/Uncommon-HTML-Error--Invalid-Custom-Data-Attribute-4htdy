# Uncommon HTML Error: Invalid Custom Data Attribute

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML related to the misuse of custom data attributes.  The error involves using a custom attribute that either isn't handled by the application or isn't validated properly, leading to unexpected behavior or validation errors.

The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.html` demonstrates the correct usage.

This issue is uncommon because it is often related to application-specific logic or validation. It is not a common syntax or semantic error like missing closing tags.
